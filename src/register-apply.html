            <p>B-Nest identifies and selects start-ups majorly in three ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hackathons</li>
                <li>Events conducted at B-Nest</li>
                <li>Online Application</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="note">
                The selection of start-ups via Hackathons and Events are completely B-Nest authority dependent and
                varies from
                event to event.<br>
                The online applications received are screened once every month.

                        If you have just begun your journey and need guidance and support to give shape to your ideas,
                        you are in
                        the <strong>Ideation</strong> or the <strong>Idea Validation Phase</strong>.

                    <li class="line">
                        Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where
                        an idea is
                        understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.
                        Ideation
                        comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from innovation, to development, to actualization.
                        Ideation can
                        be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. All the start-ups begin with this stage.
                        The
                        start-ups keep brainstorming different aspects of the business.

                        If you have a product or a service, you have made a few sales and want to boost your sales then
                        you are in
                        the Early Traction Phase.

                    <li class="line">
                        Early traction simply refers to the first wave of users. Those early adopters are crucial. The
                        reason is
                        that although they haven’t heard anything about the start-up, they still purchased the
                        product/service.
                        That means that they saw value in the product/service and also as a solution to their problem.
                        Having
                        early traction is a sign that people want to use the product/service offered by the start-up and
                        also acts
                        as an insurance for VCs and their investment. A start-up with a good early-traction attracts
                        more VCs and
                        investors.

                        If your business is in such a stage where you have significant cash flows and now you want to

                        business further then you are in the Growth Phase.

                    <li class="line">
                        This phase is characterised by growth into new markets and distribution channels. Companies in
                        the growth
                        phase need big amount of funds to expand. Also the entrepreneurs no longer have to poke their
                        nose into
                        smaller matters since there are people assigned to take up different problems. Every company at
                        this phase
                        tries to capitalise on newer possibilities and ventures. Business at this stage is marked by
                        rapid growth
                        in revenue and cash flow. The hours of hard work and late night assignments have finally paid
                        off and now
                        the entrepreneurs reap the benefits.
